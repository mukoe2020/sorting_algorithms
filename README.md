Sorting algorithms are algorithms that rearrange elements in a list or array in a specific order, typically in ascending or descending order based on some comparison criteria. Sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science and is used in various applications, such as searching, data analysis, and information retrieval. There are many different sorting algorithms, each with its own characteristics and performance trade-offs. In this project, we implemented a series of some of the sorting algorithms.
